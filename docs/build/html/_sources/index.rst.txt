Documentation
=============

``packflow`` is a software development kit (SDK) that simplifies the development process and standardizes packaging of
AI/ML running on streaming or event-based data sources.

By leveraging Packflow, teams can capitalize on numerous optimizations and utilities that are included out-of-the-box,
significantly reducing the time and effort required to onboard new capabilities. This makes Packflow an attractive
solution for organizations seeking to efficiently harness the power of their streaming data without getting bogged down
in unnecessary complexity and redundant code.

Visit the :ref:`About Packflow<about-packflow>` page for more information, or proceed to :ref:`Getting Started<getting-started>` to quickly install Packflow and build an Inference Backend.
